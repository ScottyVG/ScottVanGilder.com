## Lambda: The Swiss Army Knife of AWS

When most people think of AWS Lambda, they picture serverless APIs, cron jobs, or simple automation tasks. And sure, Lambda is great for all those things. But the longer I work in cloud infrastructure, the more I’ve come to see Lambda as my go-to Swiss Army knife—a tool I can reach for when I need to solve weird, specific, or otherwise impossible problems quickly.

I call it “everything as a Lambda,” because there’s almost nothing you can’t wire up with a bit of code and a deployment.


## Lambda as the Glue

The beauty of Lambda is that it can live in the middle of any process. Need to fetch data from an external API during your infrastructure deployment? Lambda can do it. Need to transform JSON payloads on the fly? Lambda’s your friend. Need to automate a tedious SDK operation that CloudFormation can’t handle? You guessed it—Lambda.

In my work at AWS, I’ve ended up building quite a few Lambdas that exist solely to glue pieces of infrastructure together. They’re small, focused, and incredibly powerful.


## Real-World Use Cases

Here are a couple of examples from projects I’ve worked on:

### Custom Resource Lambdas for SDK Operations

CloudFormation is fantastic—but it’s not omnipotent. There are plenty of AWS operations that just aren’t available as native CloudFormation resources. That’s where custom resources come in.

Recently, I built a Lambda custom resource that executes AWS SDK calls as part of a deployment. Instead of requiring someone to manually run a CLI command after deploying infrastructure, the custom resource handles it automatically, keeping deployments idempotent and repeatable.


### Certificate Generation and Integration

Another fun use case was building a custom resource Lambda to integrate with an external certificate authority. We had an API that could vend custom certificates, and we needed to import those certs into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) automatically. So I wrote a Lambda that:

* Calls the external API to generate a cert
* Retrieves the private key and cert chain
* Registers them into ACM for use with our infrastructure

This saved a ton of manual work and helped ensure that our deployments remained fully automated—even when integrating with services outside AWS.


## Why Lambda Fits So Well

Lambda is perfect for these jobs because:

* There’s no infrastructure to manage
* It’s cheap for small workloads
* It can run with minimal permissions scoped precisely to the task
* It deploys quickly and rolls back easily
* It scales seamlessly if you suddenly need more concurrency

Plus, if you’re already using Infrastructure-as-Code tools like CDK, deploying a Lambda function as part of your stack is ridiculously simple.


## A Few Tips for “Everything as a Lambda”

If you’re going to start solving all your odd jobs with Lambda, here are a few things I’ve learned:

* Keep Lambdas small and focused on one job
* Watch out for cold starts if your function has large dependencies
* Handle errors and edge cases explicitly so you’re not left debugging failed deployments
* Always test your custom resources thoroughly—they run during deployments, and failures there can leave your stack in a weird state


## Why I Love It

For me, there’s a certain magic in knowing that if I hit a wall with AWS tooling, I can usually solve it by dropping in a few lines of code in a Lambda. It’s fast, flexible, and lets me get on with solving bigger problems without getting bogged down in workarounds or manual steps.

So here’s to “everything as a Lambda.” Long may it reign.
