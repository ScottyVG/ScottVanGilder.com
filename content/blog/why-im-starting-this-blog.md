## Why Blog?

I’ve thought about starting a blog for years, but for one reason or another, I always found a way to put it off. Maybe I felt like I didn’t have time. Or I told myself that no one would care what I had to say. Or, honestly, I just couldn’t decide where to start.

But lately, a few things have shifted for me. Part of it is life experience. Part of it is the tech I work with every day. And part of it is thanks to the rise of generative AI, which has quietly made some of the barriers to writing lower than they’ve ever been. So here I am, finally starting the blog I’ve been meaning to write.



### Why Now?

First, I’ve reached a point in my career and my personal life where I want a space to share what I’m learning—and maybe even to think out loud a bit. I’ve spent the last several years working as a DevOps consultant at AWS, tackling complex cloud problems and helping customers build scalable, secure solutions. In that time, I’ve collected plenty of technical insights, lessons learned, and a few war stories worth telling.

At the same time, I’m always diving into personal projects, whether it’s experimenting with new tech stacks, building random tools, or chasing hobbies that have nothing to do with tech at all. I’ve realized that writing about these things helps me clarify my own thinking—and might help someone else along the way.



### GenAI as a Catalyst

Another reason I’m finally jumping in is because generative AI has completely changed how I work and learn. Whether it’s helping me brainstorm a piece of code, generate test data, or even wrangle annoying CSS layouts, GenAI has become my silent collaborator for all the tedious stuff that used to slow me down.

When it comes to writing, I always start with blank page and an idea and only will use AI to help me with gramatical issues, as grammer has never been my strong suit. I also don't want to burden my readers with more AI generated content that doesn't provide a real human perspective.



### What This Blog Will Be

So, what should you expect from this blog? To be honest, it’s going to be a bit of a stream of consciousness. I want this to be a place where I share:

* Technical deep-dives on cloud development and DevOps
* Personal dev projects and experiments
* Thoughts on emerging tech (like GenAI) and how it’s changing our industry
* Stories from travel and exploring the outdoors
* Reflections on work, life, and everything in between

I don’t plan on sticking to a rigid theme. Instead, I’m aiming for authenticity—and hoping that the things I care about will resonate with some of you reading this.



### An Open Invitation

If you’ve landed here, thanks for being curious enough to stop by. I’m excited for this space to evolve, and I hope it becomes a place for good conversations, shared insights, and maybe even a few laughs.
