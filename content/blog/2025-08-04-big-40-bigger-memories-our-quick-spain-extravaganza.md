## Big 40, Bigger Memories: Our Quick Spain Extravaganza

Turning 40 felt like a milestone worth celebrating in style, so my wife and I hopped on Swiss Air in Denver and embarked on a whirlwind, one-week tour of Spain—plus a cheeky Swiss layover—packed with sunshine, tapas, art, and lots of laughter. Here's how we squeezed a lifetime of memories into seven unforgettable days.

### Day 1: Departure & Swiss Surprise

Our journey began at DEN, boarding Swiss Air LX8017 at 5:50 PM for a nearly ten-hour flight to Zurich. Economy felt snug, but an aisle seat made stretching easier. Two hearty meals (vegetarian cheese tortellini and a beef dinner with broccoli and potatoes) plus Rivella soda kept us fueled. We watched *Conclave* and *Paddington in Peru*, then snagged a few hours of sleep.

#### Zurich Layover Adventure

With a 4 hour 40 minute layover, we dared to leave the airport. A quick 10-minute train whisked us into Altstadt, where cobblestone streets and the Gothic Grossmünster (organ echo and all!) felt like stepping into a storybook. After 75 juicy minutes exploring, we dashed back for a snack and reboarded LX2032 at 4:25 PM for Madrid.

Sometimes the best parts of travel are the unexpected detours. That brief taste of Switzerland—with its pristine streets and medieval architecture—set the perfect tone for our European adventure.

### Day 2: Welcome to Madrid

Landed at 6:45 PM, grabbed the Express Aeropuerto bus (€5, 40 min), and rolled into Atocha. Our home base: Urban Sea Hotel Atocha 113. By 8:30 PM we were sipping vino on the sixth-floor terrace, eyes on Madrid's twilight skyline. Tapas Row on Calle de Jesús whispered our names, but exhaustion won—Friday, we promised ourselves.

There's something magical about that first evening in a new city. The jet lag, the unfamiliar sounds, the anticipation of adventures ahead. Madrid welcomed us with warm air and the promise of incredible days to come.

### Day 3: Bullet Train to Barcelona

Up at dawn, Rodilla croissants in hand, we caught Ouigo 06471 at 7:02 AM. Nearly three hours later in Barcelona, we dropped bags at Hostel Grau and wandered the winding lanes on a Rick Steves audio tour through the Gothic Quarter.

#### Discovering Barcelona's Hidden Gems

Highlights: Barcelona Cathedral, the secret Jewish Quarter alcoves, and surprise gelato stops (B: Picasso & mango, S: Crema de Catalunya). The Gothic Quarter is like a medieval maze where every turn reveals another architectural treasure or hidden courtyard.

By afternoon, the Picasso Museum dazzled us with Blue Period sorrow and *Las Meninas* inspiration. A quick check-in revealed a dreamy terrace view, snack basket, and that friendly hostel vibe. We capped the day with a prix-fixe dinner at La Rita, then strolled to Sagrada Familia—Gaudí's masterpiece glowing in evening light.

Standing before the Sagrada Familia at dusk, watching the intricate facades catch the golden hour light, was one of those moments that makes you grateful for spontaneous travel decisions.

### Day 4: Running the Ramblas & Mediterranean Dips

Morning run! Seven miles along the Ramblas to the beach, toes in the Med, then hotel breakfast of cheese, jamón, fruit, and pastries. There's nothing quite like starting your day with a run through a new city—you see it wake up, smell the coffee brewing, watch the locals begin their routines.

We grabbed an AVE back to Madrid at 11 AM—luxury seats & more legroom felt like first-class dreams.

#### Back in Madrid: Art & Royalty

Checked in at Palacio San Martín, then pressed on to the Prado for a three-hour audio tour among Raphael, Velázquez, Goya, and coworkers. The Prado isn't just a museum—it's a journey through centuries of Spanish artistic genius. Standing before Velázquez's *Las Meninas* or Goya's dark paintings, you feel the weight of history and human creativity.

Retiro Park offered shade and serenity, followed by dinner at Casa Alberto (leeks with jamón, hake & prawns, violet ice cream—bold!). Sometimes the best culinary adventures happen when you order something you can't quite translate.

### Day 5: Royal Palace & Cochinas Madrileño

After hotel breakfast, a self-guided walk from Puerta del Sol led us through Mercado de San Miguel and the Almudena Cathedral. The Royal Palace kitchen tour was in Spanish, but we clung to every royal anecdote. Even when you don't understand every word, the passion of a good guide transcends language barriers.

Lunch at La Rayúa served up a pork-heavy chickpea stew worth every calorie. Post-lunch siesta for two very tired forty-somethings—because when in Spain, embrace the siesta culture.

Evening found us atop a rooftop pool on Gran Vía, overlooking Madrid's endless rooftops. We closed the night at Reina Sofía, dazzled by Picasso's *Guernica* and Dalí's surreal masterpieces. *Guernica* is one of those artworks that hits differently in person—the scale, the emotion, the historical weight all combine into something that photos simply can't capture.

### Day 6: Toledo Time Travel

Toledo beckoned with 2,500 years of history. A 30-minute train ride, a bus to Zocodover, and a Rick Steves walking tour through the Jewish Quarter made us time travelers. Gothic cathedrals, medieval walls, and lunch at Taberna Skala filled our senses.

Toledo is Spain's history compressed into a single hilltop city. Walking those narrow streets, you're literally following paths worn smooth by Romans, Visigoths, Muslims, and Christians across millennia. It's humbling and exhilarating at the same time.

By 8 PM, we were back in Madrid dreaming of churros.

### Day 7: Homebound Reflections

A pre-dawn taxi to MAD (thanks, 5 AM wake-up) and Lufthansa flights home left us sleep-deprived but elated. Afternoon touchdown at DEN reunited us with the Rocky Mountains—yet our hearts were still dancing to Spanish guitar.

### The Real Takeaways

Seven days. Two cities. One country between them. Miles of cobblestones, mountains of tapas, and memories to last the next forty years.

What struck me most about this trip wasn't just the incredible art, architecture, or food—though all of that was spectacular. It was how travel forces you out of your routines and assumptions. Every meal becomes an adventure. Every wrong turn leads to unexpected discoveries. Every conversation with a local opens a window into a different way of seeing the world.

Spain gave us history, art, and flavors that will linger long after the jet lag fades. Swiss Air gave us a taste of licorice-vanilla soda and an unexpected Swiss detour. And turning forty felt like the perfect pretext for adventure.

### Why Quick Trips Work

There's something to be said for the intensity of a short international trip. You can't see everything, so you focus on what matters most. You can't waste time, so every moment feels precious. You can't overthink, so you say yes to experiences you might normally skip.

Would I have loved two weeks in Spain? Absolutely. But sometimes constraints force creativity, and our week-long sprint through Spanish culture was exactly what we needed to mark this milestone birthday.

### What's Next?

Here's to the next big milestone—whatever it may be! But more importantly, here's to not waiting for milestones to seek adventure. The best time to explore the world is always right now, whether you're turning 40, 30, 50, or any age in between.

Spain reminded us that the world is full of incredible experiences waiting just a plane ride away. Sometimes all it takes is booking the ticket and trusting that the adventure will unfold exactly as it should.
