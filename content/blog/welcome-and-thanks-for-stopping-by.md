## $whoami - Who Am I?

I'm Scott Van Gilder, and I grew up in Jefferson, a small town in Iowa with good roots, great parents, and a wonderful community I'm proud to call home. Jefferson was the kind of place where everyone knew—or at least knew of—everyone else, and as a kid, it was the type of place where I could ride my single-speed bike from one end of town to the other in ten minutes. I was endlessly fascinated by all things RC, spending hours tinkering with cars and planes, and I loved building rockets, determined to blast them as high into outer space as I could launch them. Summers were filled with long days at the pool, competing on the local swim team and occasionally breaking a few records—a time that as I reflect on feels full of the kind of simple joys that shaped who I am today.

After graduating high school, I left Jefferson to study engineering at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. While I enjoyed the challenges of engineering, I ultimately discovered that my true passion lay in programming. I graduated from Iowa State with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, then moved to Boulder, Colorado. There, I found the Galvanize Web Development Immersive program, which helped me build on my basic coding skills and learn industry best practices in software engineering and cloud development.

Today, I work as a Professional Services consultant for Amazon Web Services (AWS), helping customers achieve their business goals by delivering tailored DevOps solutions and cloud architectures. It gives me immense pride to know I'm contributing to some of the largest projects in the world and delivering high-quality results at an incredible scale.

When I'm not working, I'm embracing life here in Superior, Colorado, where I live with my wonderful wife and son. Outside the office, you'll often find me enjoying all the typical Colorado outdoor activities—running, biking, hiking, snowboarding, and soaking up the sunshine and mountain air.
